# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? 
### The ability to start to put it all together and see how each tool builds upon each other. Being able to google different methods and then get the code to run succesfull was pretty awesome


- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
### Reuseability, saves times not having to write out the same code multiple times to iterate. Also to store the method in another variable your information can be more dynamic.
